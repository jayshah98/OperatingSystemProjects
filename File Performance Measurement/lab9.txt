Overall, the CPU the time it takes to write data to the disk decreases as buffer size increases. However, this decrease in time is exponential and tends to flatline as the buffer size reaches a point.

*************************** STEP4 ****************************

Disk performance decreases with the addition of threads, so time is longer for more threads.
